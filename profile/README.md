### Our Rules:
---------------
1. Only create repositories when absolutely necessary. It is important to minimize clutter and contain our work.
2. **All** merges and pushes to a repo should be thoroughly reviewed. Undoing a commit is a pain, so let's avoid them.
3. Name repos to match their projects, according to the schema set out in our SoP.
4. Git commit messages must be **succint**, **clear**, **informative**. They should simply describe the changes made in that commit.
5. Commit often, push when ready.
6. Nothing is made public. Ever.
7. If in doubt, ask. Do not run git commands if you do not understand them.
